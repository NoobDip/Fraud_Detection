# Fraud Detection Model - README

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to develop an effective fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes the "Fraud.csv" dataset and encompasses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and selection.

## Data Cleaning
The initial steps involve importing the dataset, exploring its characteristics, and addressing data quality issues. Duplicate entries are removed, and inconsistencies in transaction amounts are corrected. Extraneous columns related to transaction origin and destination names are dropped, streamlining the dataset for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In-depth exploration of the dataset reveals valuable insights. Notably, fraudulent transactions exhibit a tendency to have amounts exceeding the original balance of the origin account. Such insights guide subsequent modeling decisions.

## Handling Imbalanced Data
To tackle the class imbalance in fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed. This technique ensures a balanced dataset, enhancing the model's ability to identify fraud.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, are trained and evaluated. KNN emerges as a standout performer, showcasing high accuracy and precision. Notably, the model exhibits commendable results without the need for hyperparameter tuning, streamlining the modeling process.

## Model Validation
Learning curves are utilized to visualize the models' performance in terms of training and validation losses. While Decision Tree shows signs of overfitting, KNN consistently performs well across different metrics, confirming its suitability for the task.

## Final Model Selection
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is chosen as the final model due to its robust performance and resilience to overfitting. The accuracy and precision metrics meet established standards, affirming the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## Deployment
The final KNN model is saved using the pickle module, ensuring seamless deployment in a production environment. This meticulous approach guarantees that the model can be easily loaded and utilized for real-time fraud detection.

## Conclusion
This project lays the groundwork for a proficient fraud detection system. KNN, with its impressive performance and minimal need for hyperparameter tuning, stands out as a reliable choice. Continuous monitoring and refinement will be crucial for adapting the model to evolving patterns of fraudulent activities in real-world scenarios.
